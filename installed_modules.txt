### INSTALL MODULE

## django-cors-headers
# Adding CORS headers allow your resources to be accessed on other domains. 
*** It's important you understand the implications before adding the headers,
*** since you could be unintentionally opening up your site's private data to others.
pip install django-cors-headers

## django-extensions
# Django Extensions is a collection of custom extensions for the Django Framework
# These include management commands, additional database fields, admin extensions and much more.
pip install django-extensions

## REST framework JWT Auth
# This package provides JSON Web Token Authentication support for Django REST framework.
*** Unlike some more typical uses of JWTs, this module only generates authentication tokens 
*** that will verify the user who is requesting one of your DRF protected API resources.
*** The actual request parameters themselves are not included in the JWT claims which means
*** they are not signed and may be tampered with. You should only expose your API endpoints
*** over SSL/TLS to protect against content tampering and certain kinds of replay attacks.
pip install djangorestframework-jwt
